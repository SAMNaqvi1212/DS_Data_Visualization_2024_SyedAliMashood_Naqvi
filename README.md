# Visualizing Climate Change factors in Pakistan

## Introduction

This project, created by Ali Mashood, aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of climate change trends in Pakistan through effective data visualization. By exploring various factors that impact climate change, the project seeks to educate users on the current state and trends of climate change in Pakistan.

### Objective

- To create clear and insightful visualizations that highlight different factors influencing climate change in Pakistan.
- To allow users to interact with the data and explore specific regions, time periods, and climate variables.
- To emphasize the urgency of addressing climate change through compelling visual narratives.

### Key Findings

- **CO2 Emissions**: CO2 emissions from both solid and liquid fuels have generally increased over the years, with liquid fuel emissions rising more significantly.
- **Population Trends**: Population growth peaked in the 1980s and has since declined, with urban population growth consistently outpacing overall population growth.
- **Rainfall Variability**: Mean annual rainfall has shown significant fluctuations without a clear long-term trend, posing challenges for agricultural planning.
- **Agricultural Productivity**: Cereal yields have consistently increased from 1970 to 2015, indicating improvements in agricultural practices and technology.
- **Agricultural Land and Rainfall**: There is no direct correlation between the percentage of agricultural land and mean rainfall, with agricultural land remaining stable while rainfall shows high variability.

### Conclusion

The visualizations provided in this project aim to foster a deeper understanding of climate change impacts in Pakistan and encourage informed decision-making and policy planning to address these challenges.
