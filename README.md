# 🌍 Visualizing Global Climate Change

## 📋 Introduction

This project, created by **Ali Mashood**, provides a comprehensive analysis of climate change trends in Pakistan through effective data visualization. By exploring various factors that impact climate change, the project seeks to educate users on the current state and trends of climate change in Pakistan.

### 🎯 Objective

- 📊 Create clear and insightful visualizations highlighting different factors influencing climate change in Pakistan.
- 🧩 Allow users to interact with the data and explore specific regions, time periods, and climate variables.
- 📢 Emphasize the urgency of addressing climate change through compelling visual narratives.
- 🌱 Encourage sustainable practices and policy-making through data-driven insights.

### 🔍 Key Findings

1. **CO2 Emissions**
   - CO2 emissions from both solid and liquid fuels have generally increased over the years.
   - Liquid fuel emissions have risen more significantly compared to solid fuels.

2. **Population Trends**
   - Population growth peaked in the 1980s and has since declined.
   - Urban population growth consistently outpaced overall population growth, indicating significant urbanization.

3. **Rainfall Variability**
   - Mean annual rainfall has shown significant fluctuations without a clear long-term trend.
   - These fluctuations pose challenges for agricultural planning and water resource management.

4. **Agricultural Productivity**
   - Cereal yields have consistently increased from 1970 to 2015, indicating improvements in agricultural practices and technology.
   - Significant milestones in the mid-1990s and early 2000s suggest periods of notable agricultural advancements.

5. **Agricultural Land and Rainfall**
   - No direct correlation between the percentage of agricultural land and mean rainfall.
   - Agricultural land has remained stable while rainfall shows high variability.
